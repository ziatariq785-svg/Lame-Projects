        <h3>The Cold War Catalyst and Global Proliferation</h3>
        <p>The AK-47 was adopted by the Soviet Army in 1949, becoming the symbol of the military might of the Warsaw Pact nations. As the Cold War intensified, the Soviet Union and China widely distributed the rifle, along with its manufacturing blueprints, to communist allies, revolutionary groups, and anti-colonial movements across the globe. This strategy served to project Soviet political influence and arm proxy forces without direct military intervention, leading to its massive, uncontrolled spread. With an estimated 100 million AK-type rifles produced globally, it became the most widely proliferated weapon in history.</p>
        <h3>The Weapon of the Underdog: Key Conflicts</h3>
        <p>The AK-47 earned its legendary status on the battlefields of the developing world, where its durability was a major asset over more complex Western designs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Vietnam War (1955–1975):</b><br>This conflict cemented the AK-47's reputation. Used extensively by the Viet Cong (VC) and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), its robust, gas-operated design rarely malfunctioned in the wet, muddy jungle environment. This reliability gave communist forces a distinct advantage over early versions of the American M16, which were prone to jamming unless meticulously cleaned.</li>
            <li><b>Decolonization and Liberation Movements (1960s-1970s):</b><br> The AK became the standard arm for African and Asian groups fighting for independence against colonial powers (France, Portugal, etc.). Groups like the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) and the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) used it as a primary tool for revolution, making it an icon of anti-imperialism and liberation.</li>
            <li><b>War (1979–1989):</b><br>Ironically, the AK-47 was used against the very power that created it. The Soviet-issued AK-74 was the standard rifle for the Red Army, but the US and its allies often supplied the Afghan Mujahideen with Chinese-made AK-47s (Type 56) to fight the Soviets, further increasing its global circulation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design Features and Legacy</h3>
        <p>The AK-47 is renowned for its simple construction, ease of use, and ability to function reliably in harsh conditions. Its selective-fire capability, rugged stamped steel receiver, and loose tolerances allow it to operate with minimal maintenance. These features made it ideal for irregular forces and conscript armies.</p>
        <h3>Symbolism and Cultural Impact</h3>
        <p>Beyond its technical merits, the AK-47 became a symbol of revolution and resistance. Its silhouette appears on national flags, emblems, and propaganda worldwide. The rifle’s legacy continues in modern conflicts, with derivatives and copies still in use by military and paramilitary groups.</p>
